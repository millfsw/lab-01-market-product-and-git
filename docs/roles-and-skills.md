## Personal reflection

I chose the role of a full-stack developer because it has been my primary and most attractive goal since entering the IT field. I was drawn to this direction from the start, as I love programming and the idea of creating applications and websites for people. My current skillset does not yet fully match the market demands, though I am already familiar with some of the necessary tools. This motivates me to continue progressing, deepening my knowledge in both frontend and backend development. This semester, I would particularly like to focus on several key skills. Firstly, I want to learn new programming languages. I believe that knowing multiple languages is a major advantage for any developer. Secondly, I would like to deepen my knowledge of SQL databases. Most applications and websites use databases, and it is one of the core requirements in this profession. Thirdly, I want to continue learning tools that streamline project work, such as Git. I would like to explore its new features and capabilities in more detail. Mastering these areas will help me become a more versatile specialist and better meet market demands.

### Description of the group Preparation (Search & Cart)

This group of sets describes the process of seraching for products (User browses catalog and selects items) and adding them to the cart (function Add to Cart).  

**Sequence of steps:**
1. User browses catalog andselects items.
2. Click "Add to Cart".
3. RPC: addToCart(sku_id, qty).
4. Update Session Cart
5. HSET cart:{user_id} (TTL 7 days).
6. OK.
7. Cart Update (Total Price).
8. UI Update (Badge Counter)

**Components, which talk to each other:**
* **User:** searches for products and adds them to the cart
* **Cart Service:** manages the state of the shopping cart, receives information about products
* **Storefront Gateway:** it processes requests from the application.
* **Redis (Hot Data):** temporarily stores shopping cart data.

## Assumptions

1. I assume that all user applications (web and mobile) connect to the system through a single central component called the API Gateway, which helps control all incoming traffic and protect internal services.
2. I assume that different databases (for the cart, for orders) are physically separated and located on different servers, so that a high load on one type of data does not slow down the operation of other parts of the system.

## Open questions

1. How exactly does the system decide which specific internal server should process a user's request after it passes through the main gateway (API Gateway)?
2. How exactly is the enormous volume of order data distributed among different physical database machines?

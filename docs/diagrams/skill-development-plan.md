## Skill: C++ Programming

## About the skill

C++ is a powerful low-level programming language that provides direct control over hardware resources and memory. Learning this language is critical for an engineer, as it develops a deep understanding of how computers, pointers, and memory management work under the hood. This skill will help me write more efficient and optimized code, even in higher-level languages.

## Goals

**1. SMART Goal 1:** By the end of this semester, I must learn C++ semantics to better understand the programming language.

**2. SMART Goal 2:** By the end of the semester, I must complete all assignments for the SSAD course.

## Planning

My study plan is for the current semester and includes a combination of theory and practice. My primary resources will be the cours Software Systems Analysis and Design. First, I will focus on learning syntax and basic data types. Then, I'll move on to learning OOP (classes, inheritance, polymorphism). Finally, I'll learn design patterns. Practice will consists of solving problems in labs and submitting the assignments.

## Tracking

I will use GitHub to track my progress: a weekly commit to the repository with the lab solution will show my progress. My results of assignments will also be visible on codeforce.
